# About This Site

## Why This Site?

1. When learning Object Pascal with [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org), I found that while wikis were informative, they could be challenging to follow due to my initial knowledge gaps and English being a second language.
2. I discovered many valuable resources (or "gems") for Free Pascal (and Lazarus) and wanted to consolidate them for easier access and quick retrieval.
3. I find the process of documenting itself to be therapeutic and clarifying.

Hence, this site.

Here, I'm compiling my own code snippets, examples from others, and related resources for studying [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org). I hope that fellow learners and developers will find this collection useful too.

I've taken care to acknowledge the original location of information & authors whenever possible. If I overlooked anyone, please inform me.

Thanks for reading.
