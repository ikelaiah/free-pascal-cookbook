# About This Site

## Why This Site?

1. When learning Object Pascal with [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org), I found that while wikis were informative, I found them challenging to follow due to my initial knowledge gaps and English being a second language.
2. I discovered many valuable resources for [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org) (and [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org)) and wanted to consolidate them in one place for easier access and quick retrieval.
3. I find the process of documenting itself to be therapeutic and clarifying.

Hence, this site.

## What You'll Find Here

This cookbook is a collection of practical code examples, tutorials, and curated resources for learning [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org) and the [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org).
