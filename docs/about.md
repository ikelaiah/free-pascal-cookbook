# About This Site

## Why This Site?

1. When I started to learn Object Pascal with [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org), I found the wikis informative, but difficult for me to follow due to my knowledge gap and English as second language.
2. I found gems on Free Pascal (and Lazarus) out there and would like to put them all in one bucket for quick retrieval.
3. Documenting stuff is theraputic.

Hence, this site.

I'm compiling my own snippets and others, also related resources for studying [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org). I'm hoping others would find these collections useful too.

I've taken care to acknowledge the original location of information & authors whenever possible. If I overlooked anyone, please inform me.

Thanks for reading.
