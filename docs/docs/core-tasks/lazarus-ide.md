## Compile and run

You have choices. Pick one.

1. Use ++f9++ to compile (as necessary) and run *with the debugger*. The debugger notifies of any exceptions in a pop-up.

2. Use ++shift+ctrl+f9++ to compile (as necessary) and run *without the debugger*.

3. Use ++ctrl+f9++ if you'd like to compile without running it in the IDE. You will run the executable manually via a CLI.
