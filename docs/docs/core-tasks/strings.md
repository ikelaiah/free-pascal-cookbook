# Strings

## What is a `String`?

Depending on compiler setting, a `String` in FPC is an alias for;

- `ShortString` (fixed 255 length),
- `AnsiString` (variable length) or
- `UnicodeString` (UTF16).

When `{$H+}` is not specified, or `{$H-}`, `String` is an alias for `ShortString`.

Any `ShortString` have a maximum length of 255 characters with the implicit codepage `CP_ACP`. Short strings are always assumed to use the system code page.

When `{$H+}` is specified, `String` is an alias for `AnsiString`.

Any `String` is essentially an `AnsiString` with the `DefaultSystemCodePage` declared in it; `AnsiString(CP_ACP)`. And if the default system code page is `65001`, then any `String` is `UTF-8`. 

With `{$mode delpiunicode}` switch, `string` is an alias for `Unicodestring` string.

Commonly on Windows, the system code page is `1252`. If the system code page is `1252`, then any `String` is `1252`.

## Display UTF-8 on a console

```pascal linenums="1"
begin
  WriteLn('Âã§Â•ã,Âã§Âãâ„Å´„Å™„Çã,Î∂ÄÏßÄÎü∞ÌïòÎã§!üëç');
  WriteLn('Press Enter key to exit');
  ReadLn;
end.                                 
```

Alternatively, you can assign your UTF-8 test to a `string` variable.

```pascal linenums="1"
var
  s: string = 'Âã§Â•ã,Âã§Âãâ„Å´„Å™„Çã,Î∂ÄÏßÄÎü∞ÌïòÎã§!üëç';

begin
  WriteLn(s);
end.                        
```

!!! Note for Windows Users

    If you see garbage characters on console;
    
    1. your console might not support code page 65001, or
    2. your windows does not support UTF on API level (only read/write file in UTF-8)
   
    See this [answer from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57134096) on how to enable code page 65001 on your console.


!!! Warning
   
    The same [answer from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57134096) also shows how to enable UTF-8 on Windows (system-wide). 
   
    **DO NOT MISS** the caveat section and comments in from that answer.
      
    ***Enabling UTF-8 system-wide on Windows is currently in beta and could lead to unintended system-wide side effects.***

## What is my system's default codepage?

See [https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/system/defaultsystemcodepage.html](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/rtl/system/defaultsystemcodepage.html)

```pascal linenums="1"
begin
  WriteLn(DefaultSystemCodePage); 
end.                                 
```

If it says `65001`, then you should be able to see UTF-8 characters on the console.


## Remove trailing chars at the end of a string

!!! Contribution

    Gustavo 'Gus' Carreno, from the [Unofficial Free Pascal Discord server](Source: https://discord.com/channels/570025060312547359/896807098518732901/1218403991092985877), shared a neat trick to remove trailing characters by using `SetLength(str, length(str) - n);`.

Let's say you have a loop that append strings with trailing characters at the end.

One way to remove trailing characters is use a flag to inside the `for` loop. The logic would be: do not add commas or spaces if we are at the end of the loop.

A simpler way is to use `SetLength(str, length(str) - n_chars_to_remove);`.

See the example below. 

1. The `for` loop completes a sentence with a comma and a space at the end. Line 19-20.
2. The trick; `SetLength(line, length(line) - 2);` removes the last 2 chars from the end of the sentence. Line 29.

```pascal linenums="1" hl_lines="19 20 29"
program RemoveTrailingChars;

{$mode objfpc}{$H+}{$J-}

uses
  {$IFDEF UNIX}
  cthreads,
  {$ENDIF}
  Classes;

var
  cities: array of string = ('Sydney', 'Melbourne', 'Surabaya', 'Malang');
  city, line: string;

begin

  // Building a sentence using the array of string.
  line := 'I have been to the following cities: ';
  for city in cities do
    line := line + city + ', ';

  // Now, line has a trailing comma and a space at the end.
  WriteLn(line);

  // Here is a trick to remove additional characters at the end of a string
  // by Gustavo 'Gus' Carreno,  2024-03-16 @ 14:42.
  // Simply use SetLength(str, length(str) - n_chars_to_remove);

  SetLength(line, length(line) - 2);

  // Finally, just add a dot.
  line := line + '.';
  WriteLn(line);

  // Pause console
  ReadLn;
end.
```
