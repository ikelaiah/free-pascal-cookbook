# Multi-threading with `TThread` Part III - Snippets

Here are collections of snippets solving various tasks using multi-threading.

## Run a task on a thread with a variable

```pascal linenums="1"
program EX1SingleThread;

{$mode objfpc}{$H+}{$J-}

uses
  {$IFDEF UNIX}
  cmem, cthreads,
  {$ENDIF}
  Classes { you can add units after this };

type
  // The TThread class encapsulates the native thread support of the OS.
  // To create a thread, (1) declare a child of the TThread object, ...
  TMyThread = class(TThread)
    // (with a data to work with)
  private
    aString: string;
  protected
    // (2) override the Execute method, and ...
    procedure Execute; override;
  public
    // (3) lastly, you may include a constructor to setup variables
    // for executing this thread.
    constructor Create(isSuspended: boolean; message: string);
  end;

  constructor TMyThread.Create(isSuspended: boolean; message: string);
  begin

    // Call parent's constructor
    // If user pass True, thread won't start automatically
    inherited Create(isSuspended);

    // Assign a data to work with.
    self.aString:=message;

    // Won't free the thread when finished.
    // The thread will be freed manually on the main block.
    FreeOnTerminate:=False;
  end;

  procedure TMyThread.Execute;
  begin
    // Execute thread, and DO SOMETHING in this thread.

    // Example: if the thread has a data to work with,
    //          use it to achieve a goal.
    WriteLn('Thread ID ', ThreadID, ' is printing ', self.aString);

    // Example: simulate a long running process.
    Sleep(1000);
  end;

var
  mythread:TMyThread;

// Main block --------------------------------------------------
begin

// Create a thread, suspended
myThread:=TMyThread.Create(True, 'Hello, World!');

// Debug line
WriteLn('We are in the main thread');

// Start the thread
myThread.Start;

// Wait until the thread is done before going back to
// the main thread.
myThread.WaitFor;

// Free threads manually.
myThread.Free;

// Debug line.
WriteLn('We are in the main thread again');

// Pause console.
WriteLn('Press enter key to quit');
ReadLn;

end.

## Sum numbers in an array

Important features of this example.

1. Use of `TIntegerDynArray`, which is a dynamic array of integers.
2. Thread Class `TMyThread` inherits from `TThread`. This class encapsulates the logic for summing a segment of the array within each thread.
3. The constructor `TMyThread.Create` initialises the thread with the input array, start index, and end index. This setup ensures each thread works on a specific portion of the array.
4. The `Execute` method in `TMyThread` performs the actual summing of numbers within the assigned segment of the array.
5. Main program
      - Calculates the segment size for each thread using `Math.Ceil((Length(inputArray) + MAX_THREADS - 1) / MAX_THREADS)`, ensuring that each thread gets an equal or almost equal portion of the array to process.
      - Creates and starts each thread, passing in the relevant segment of the array.
      - After all threads complete their work, collect the partial sums from each thread and calculate the total sum.
6. Manual memory cleanup by setting `FreeOnTerminate := False` and manually freeing the threads after collecting their results.
7. Lastly, the program displays information about each thread's segment and its partial sum.

## Increment a counter multi-threading

This snippet features:

- Use of `TRTLCriticalSection` to ensure only one thread can increment a counter variable

```pascal
program CriticalSectionIncrementCounter;

{

  An example adapted from \lazarus\examples\multithreading\multithread_critical
  for CLI.
  This is a simple example using 4 threads to increase a counter (shared
  variable).

  To enable critical sections, set isCriticalSectionEnabled to True.
  To disable critical sections, set isCriticalSectionEnabled to False.

  With critical sections you will always get 4,000,000.
  Without you will see different results on each run.

  Important: In most Unix like systems, the cthread unit must be added
             to the uses section of the .lpr file. Further, cmem is likely to
             be significently faster so add it as well. Due to how the units
             work a sensible order is cmem, cthreads and then perhaps cwstrings.
             But note that heaptrc does not work with cmem so comment it out
             while testing/debugging.

## Assigns student IDs to student names

This program assigns an ID to each student name from a text file and sorts them by student ID.

This snippet features:

- `TFileStream` and `TStreamReader` for reading lines from a text file
- Use of four threads to complete the task
- Use of rounding-up division to split the workload between threads
- Use of `TRTLCriticalSection` to ensure only one thread can write to the output list


### The `common.pas` of assigning IDs to names

This file holds the common type and variable declarations.

There are two important common variables here:

1. `startStudentID: int64 = 200000;` - This variable specifies the starting index for student IDs. All threads will read from this variable and increment it by one for other threads to read from. Therefore, reading and incrementing this variable MUST be done within a critical section to avoid race conditions.
2. `finalStudentList: TStudentList;` - A list of TStudent records containing names and student IDs. All threads will write their output here, so writing to this variable MUST also be done within a critical section.
  

```pascal linenums="1"
unit Common;

{$mode ObjFPC}{$H+}

interface

uses
  Classes, SysUtils, Generics.Defaults, Generics.Collections, Math;


type
  // A record to hold student information.
  TStudent = record
    Name: string;
    id: integer;
  end;

type
  // A list to hold student records, along with a comparer for
  // sorting the list afterwards.
  TStudentList = specialize TList<TStudent>;
  TStudentListComparer = specialize TComparer<TStudent>;

type
  // A type of string list.
  TStrList = specialize TList<string>;

const
  // Number of maximum threads to use.
  maxThreads: int64 = 4;

var
  // This variable specifies the lowest index for student ID.
  // All threads will be reading from this variable and increase by one
  // for other threads to read from.
  // Hence, reading and increment of this variable MUST be done
  // from within a critical section to avoid race.
  startStudentID: int64 = 200000;

  // A list of TStudent records. All threads will write student names and
  // student IDs into this variable.
  // Hence, writing to this variable MUST be done from within
  // a critical section too.
  finalStudentList: TStudentList;

// Custom comparison function for sorting by name - ascending
function CompareID(const LeftItem, RightItem: TStudent): integer;

implementation

// Custom comparison function for sorting by student id - ascending
function CompareID(const LeftItem, RightItem: TStudent): integer;
begin
  Result := CompareValue(LeftItem.id, RightItem.id);
end;

end.
```

### The `customthread.pas` of assigning IDs to names

This file defines the implementation of a custom thread based on `TThread`.

There are important things to note here:

1. The implementation includes a `destructor` to clean up the list used by the threads for the task (lines 30, 63-69).
2. The thread receives an array but only processes a portion of it based on the rounding-up division algorithm defined in the main block.
3. `FreeOnTerminate := False` as the main thread is responsible for managing the freeing of all threads (line 47).
4. The `Execute` method updates shared variables within a critical section (lines 79-91).

    end;
  end;
end;

end.
```

### The main program of assigning IDs to names

Key features of the main snippet:

1. The text file is read into `strList`.
2. Threads are created and assigned specific subarrays to process.
3. Critical sections ensure safe access to shared variables.
4. After the threads finish, the results are sorted and printed.

```pascal linenums="1"
program AssignStudentIDs;

{
 This program assigns student ID to each name from a text file by
 using N number of threads.

 Pre-requisite

    - TThread for managing the threads.
    - TRTLCriticalSection for ensuring only one thread can modify a shared
      variable at one time.
    - Input text file containing a list of names. For example;

    Alyssa Morgan
    Declan Hayes
    Nora Patel
    Miles Thompson
    Sienna Larson
    Kellan Rivera
    Camille Chang
    Jensen Park
    Amara Singh
    Holden Myers
    Elise Howard
    Luca Griffin
    Reagan Patel
    Kian Gallagher
    Mara Nguyen
    ...
    ...

 Algorithm

    - Read the text file into an array.
      - All threads will read from the same array, but at differing start and
        finish indexes. This depends on the number of max threads.
    - Assign workloads to each thread.
      - Specify the start and finish indexes to each thread.
      - Will use the rounding up division method to ensure near-equal division
        of workload for each thread.
    - Wait for the threads to finish and then free them.
    - Sort the final student list
    - Print results on screen.

 Sample Output

   $ ./AssignStudentIDs.exe student-names.txt
   No of students         : 200
   Max threads            : 4
   subArray size round up : 51

              Ceil((totalElements + N - 1) div N).
              - When we divide totalElements by N, we get the quotient of the
                division. However, if totalElements is not evenly divisible by N,
                there might be a remainder.
              - In the context of splitting an array into subarrays, we want
                each subarray to have approximately the same number of elements.
                Therefore, we want to ensure that any remaining elements after
                dividing totalElements by N are included in the last subarray to
                avoid losing data.
              - The expression Ceil((totalElements + N - 1) div N); effectively
                rounds up the division by adding N - 1 to totalElements before
                performing the division. **This ensures that any remainder is
                accounted for in the last subarray**.

## A Large Text File Parser

This example demonstrates how to parse a text file using multi-threading. The code reads the text file, divides it into chunks, and assigns each chunk to a different thread. Each thread then prints the number of bytes it processed and the first line of its chunk.

```pascal linenums="1"
program LargeTextFileParser;

{
 Description

 This program is a simple example of parsing of a text file using N threads.
 The code reads and divides the text file into chunks and assigns these chunks
 to different threads, ensuring that no chunk splits a paragraph or sentence.

 Workflow

 1. File Reading      - Read the file in 12MB chunks.
 2. Data Integrity    - Ensure chunks do not split paragraphs or sentences by
                        adjusting the file pointer based on the last newline
                        character.
 3. Thread Management - Use up to N threads to process chunks in parallel.
 4. Display Output    - Print the size of each chunk and the first line of each chunk.

          Next, adjust file position to the character after the last newline.

          ---
          Explanation
          ---

          Let's say we have a buffer size of 1000 characters, and the last
          newline character is found at index 950.
          The buffer contains 50 characters after the last newline.

          bufferSize  = 1000
          lastNewLine = 950
          bufferSize - lastNewLine - 1 = 1000 - 950 - 1 = 49
          Assuming SizeOf(Char) = 1 (for simplicity),

          ```pascal
          fStream.Position := fStream.Position - 49 * SizeOf(Char);
          ```

          This means the file position is moved back by 49 bytes, so the next
          read operation will start at the 951st character in the buffer,
          which is the character immediately following the last newline.
          This ensures that no line is split between two chunks and maintains
          the integrity of the data being processed.
        }
        fStream.Position := fStream.Position - (bufferSize - lastNewLine - 1) * SizeOf(char);

        // Increment active thread counter
        Inc(activeThreads);

        // If max threads are active, wait for them to finish
        if activeThreads = MAX_THREADS then
        begin
          for index := 0 to MAX_THREADS - 1 do
          begin
            threadList[index].WaitFor;
          end;
          activeThreads := 0;
        end;
      end; // -- End of the `while fStream.Position < fStream.Size do` loop.

      // Wait for any remaining threads to complete
      for index := 0 to activeThreads - 1 do
      begin
        threadList[index].WaitFor;
      end;

    finally
