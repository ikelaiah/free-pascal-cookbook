Welcome to my Free Pascal Cookbook!

This is a collection of **practical examples and tutorials** for learning Object Pascal with the [Free Pascal Compiler (FPC)](https://www.freepascal.org) and [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org). Whether you're just starting out or you're picking up a new language, you'll find clear explanations and code you can try right away.

**New to Free Pascal?** Start with [Hello, World!](docs/basics/basic-hello-world.md) and then explore [common data types](docs/basics/common-data-types.md).

For more tutorials and links, check out [Resources](docs/resources/docs-sites.md).

## Official Documentation

Once you've learned the basics here, the official guides have everything else you need. Don't worry if they look long at first—this cookbook will help you understand them!

**Free Pascal Compiler (FPC)**

-   **[User's Guide](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/current/user/user.html)**: Learn the basics of using the compiler.
-   **[Programmer's Guide](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/current/prog/prog.html)**: Explore programming with Free Pascal.
-   **[Language Reference](https://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/current/ref/ref.html)**: The complete guide to the Object Pascal language.
-   For all FPC guides, see the [FPC Documentation Page](https://www.freepascal.org/docs.var).

**Lazarus IDE**

-   **[Lazarus Documentation](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Lazarus_Documentation)**: Your main hub for Lazarus guides, including the LCL (Lazarus Component Library).
-   **[Lazarus FAQ](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Lazarus_FAQ)**: Find answers to common questions.

## Installation

To try the code examples on your computer, you need the **Free Pascal Compiler (FPC)**.

**Not sure which to choose?** Most beginners should pick **FPC and Lazarus IDE** because Lazarus has a visual editor that makes coding easier.

=== "FPC and Lazarus IDE (Recommended)"

    - Download [the Lazarus IDE installer](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/index.php?page=downloads) for your computer.
    - This installs both FPC and Lazarus IDE together.

=== "FPC Only"

    - Download [the FPC installer](https://www.freepascal.org/download.html) for your computer.
    - Use this if you prefer to use a text editor like VS Code instead of Lazarus IDE.


**We tested with**: FPC **3.2.2** and Lazarus IDE **3.6**.
