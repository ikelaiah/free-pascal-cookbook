<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Learn **Free Pascal** with practical, ready-to-run examples. Whether you're a complete beginner or exploring Object-Oriented Pascal, this cookbook covers everything from "Hello, World!" to advanced concepts like generics and interfaces.

This cookbook is a collection of tutorials, code examples, and study notes for the [Free Pascal programming language](https://www.freepascal.org) and [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org).

## What's Inside

This cookbook covers:

- **Basics** - Variables, data types, and getting started with Free Pascal
- **Control Flow** - Loops, conditions, and making decisions in code
- **Functions & Procedures** - Writing reusable code and organizing your programs
- **Object-Oriented Programming** - Classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and interfaces
- **Advanced Topics** - Generics, pointers, and working with memory
- **Practical Examples** - Real, ready-to-run code you can test immediately

## Who Is This For

This cookbook is designed for:

- **Complete beginners** to programming who want to learn Free Pascal from scratch
- **High school students** (ages 15-18) exploring programming languages
- **Developers** familiar with other languages who want to explore Object Pascal
- **Hobbyists** interested in learning Free Pascal and Lazarus IDE
- **Anyone** looking for clear, practical examples and explanations

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Online (Recommended)

The easiest way to start is to visit the cookbook site: [https://ikelaiah.github.io/free-pascal-cookbook](https://ikelaiah.github.io/free-pascal-cookbook)

The site is nicely formatted and easy to navigate. Just pick a topic and start learning!

### Browse Locally

You can also browse the `.md` files directly in this repository. All the content is here; the website just makes it prettier to read.

### Installation

No installation required! Everything you need is already here or linked from the cookbook. To **use** Free Pascal though, you'll need to:

1. Install the [Free Pascal Compiler](https://www.freepascal.org/download.html)
2. (Optional) Install the [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/download/) for a more comfortable development experience

Both are free and work on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Featured Topics

- [**Control Flow**](docs/basics/) - Making decisions with `if` and looping with `for`/`while`
- [**Functions & Procedures**](docs/basics/) - Writing code you can reuse
- [**Introduction to Object Pascal**](docs/basics/intro-objpas-fpc.md) - Explore classes and OOP concepts
